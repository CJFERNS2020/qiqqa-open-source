Hi there,

Word is running and Qiqqa still can't connect to it, then your registry settings for the "Word Automation COM interface" might have been corrupted when you installed/uninstalled different versions of Word. 

This directory contains a number of "registry patches" that can help fix the problem in a manner similar to what is discussed here:

To potentially fix the problem, select and double-click to install the registry file corresponding to your correct version of Word.

Thanks,
Qiqqa Support
