% This is a simple \texttt{conference} object whose short name is
% ``NSDI'' and long name is ``Symposium on Networked System Design and
% Implementation''. In addition, it carries some conditional fields; that
% is, fields that are included in the object only if they match the data
% in the referring context. For instance, if the \texttt{year} field of the
% referring object is equal to 2006, the \texttt{nsdi} object additionally
% has the fields \texttt{address=SanJose, month=may}. In a different year,
% a different conditional might be triggered. Any, all, or none of the
% conditionals mentioned may be appropriate (although obviously in this
% case, the year can only have one value).

% By itself, conditional fields are not very useful; their value in
% simplifying object references becomes apparent when they are used in
% context. Look at the following reference:

@inproceedings{credence,
  title = "Experience with an Object Reputation System for Peer-to-Peer Filesharing",
  author = "kwalsh and egs",
  booktitle = nsdi,
  year = 2006
