@conference{usenix = usenix,

% Obviously, the best solution is to add the following line to the entry
% in the system conferences database:

%   [year=2006] address=Boston, month=may,

% However, you may not have permission to edit the database.  Now there are
% two options: Cut-and-paste the usenix object into some local database with
% a new name so there is no conflict, or put the address and month directly
% into the paper's entry.  Neither one is a good solution.  What you want is
% to be able to extend the \texttt{usenix} object even though it is in
% another database you can't edit.
% 
% Enter the \texttt{@extend} primitive.  The following solves the example:

@extend{usenix,
  [year=2006] address=Boston, month=may,
}
