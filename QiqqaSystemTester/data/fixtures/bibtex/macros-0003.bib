Deal correctly with TeX commands in values:

@electronic{IEEEexample:IEEEwebsite,
  title         = "The {IEEE} Website",
  url           = "http://www.ieee.org/",
  year          = "2015",
  key           = "IEEE"
}


The BibTeX user's guide.
The filename could have been put in the URL instead. But, there might
be other interesting things for the user in the same directory - and
the filename might change before the directory that contains it.
@electronic{IEEEexample:bibtexuser,
  author        = "Oren Patashnik",
  title         = "{{\BibTeX}}ing",
  howpublished  = "{btxdoc.pdf}",
  url           = "http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex",
  month         = nov,
  year          = "2010"
}


The BibTeX style designer's guide.
@electronic{IEEEexample:bibtexdesign,
  author        = "Oren Patashnik",
  title         = "Designing {{\BibTeX}} Styles",
  howpublished  = "{btxhak.pdf}",
  url           = "http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex",
  month         = nov,
  year          = "2010"
}


A comprehensive BibTeX tutorial.
@electronic{IEEEexample:tamethebeast,
  author        = "Nicolas Markey",
  title         = "Tame the BeaST  ---  The B to X of {{\BibTeX}}",
  url           = "http://www.ctan.org/pkg/tamethebeast",
  month         = oct,
  year          = "2009"
}
