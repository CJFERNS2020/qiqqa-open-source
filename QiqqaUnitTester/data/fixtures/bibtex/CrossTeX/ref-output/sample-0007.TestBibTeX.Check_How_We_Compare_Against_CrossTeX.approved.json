    "% CrossTeX example",
    "% This is a simple \\texttt{conference} object whose short name is\r\n% ``NSDI'' and long name is ``Symposium on Networked System Design and\r\n% Implementation''. In addition, it carries some conditional fields; that\r\n% is, fields that are included in the object only if they match the data\r\n% in the referring context. For instance, if the \\texttt{year} field of the\r\n% referring object is equal to 2006, the \\texttt{nsdi} object additionally\r\n% has the fields \\texttt{address=SanJose, month=may}. In a different year,\r\n% a different conditional might be triggered. Any, all, or none of the\r\n% conditionals mentioned may be appropriate (although obviously in this\r\n% case, the year can only have one value).\r\n\r\n% By itself, conditional fields are not very useful; their value in\r\n% simplifying object references becomes apparent when they are used in\r\n% context. Look at the following reference:"
