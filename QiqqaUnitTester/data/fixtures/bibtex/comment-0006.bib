@comment { this is a correct @comment as it does have curly-brace delims where it should }

@comment { this is another *legal* @comment as it does have {} curly-brace delims where it should,
it's just that it's followed by more comment plaintext after that initial closing brace: '}' on
that first line.

Nevertheless, BibTeX should consider this entire blather as comment though...
