Now open source award-winning Qiqqa research management tool for Windows.

This version includes **every** feature available in [Commercial Qiqqa](qiqqa.com), including Premium and Premium+.

> Unfortunately we have had to **remove the web cloud sync** ability as that involves storage costs. Users are encouraged to migrate their Web Libraries into Intranet libraries, and **use Google Drive or Dropbox**
 as the 'sync point' for those libraries.
