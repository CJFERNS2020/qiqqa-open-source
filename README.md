Now open source award-winning Qiqqa research management tool for Windows.

This version includes **every** feature available in [Commercial Qiqqa](qiqqa.com), including Premium and Premium+.

> Unfortunately we have had to **remove the web cloud sync** ability as that involves storage costs. Users are encouraged to migrate their Web Libraries into Intranet libraries, and **use Google Drive or Dropbox**
 as the 'sync point' for those libraries.


## Download Qiqqa Open Source

* [Download Qiqqa Open Source](https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/tree/master/Qiqqa.Build/Packages) installer for v80 and newer releases.
	> Installer files should be uploaded to [releases](https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/releases) in the future.

* [Test bleeding edge](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qiqqa-open-source/releases) Qiqqa Open Source **experimental** releases.

	> **DO NOTE** that these releases are only lightly tested and may include grave bugs. Backup your library before testing these, even if you like living on the edge...

* Qiqqa Commercial software installer releases v66 to v79 are available at [qiqqa.com](www.qiqqa.com/Download) at least until 2020 and also [here](https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/tree/master/Qiqqa-Software-Installer-Releases).

### Notifications of new releases

To be notified of new releases [subscribe](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/qiqqa-releases) to the Google Group 'qiqqa-releases' (not working yet).


## Documentation For Users

Documentation still needs a **lot** of work. All help is appreciated. The Commercial Qiqqa manual is available at [qiqqa.org](http://qiqqa.org/The.Qiqqa.Manual.html).

Other documentation material is being added as we go; the sources for that are available in this repository's [docs](./docs) directory.


## Fixes & Additions to Qiqqa since v79

For list of changes in released versions see [CHANGELOG](../../blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) or [CHANGELOG-full](../../blob/master/CHANGELOG_full.md).

For bleeding edge development changes see [closed bugs list](https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

@GerHobbelt has joined as a collaborator in the qiqqa-open-source mainline repository; the bleeding edge of his work on Qiqqa can be observed [at this fork](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qiqqa-open-source). Qiqqa pre-releases and experimental releases will be made available there first at [the releases page](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qiqqa-open-source/releases).
