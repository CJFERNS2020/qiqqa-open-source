The open-sourced version of the award-winning Qiqqa research management tool for Windows.

This version includes EVERY feature available in Qiqqa, including Premium and Premium+.

> Unfortunately we have had to remove the web cloud sync ability as that is the one area that involves storage costs.  **Users are encouraged to migrate their Web Libraries into Intranet libraries, and use Google Drive or Dropbox as the 'sync point' for those libraries.**


## Qiqqa Open Source Software Releases

- Qiqqa Open Source software installer releases [are available in the mainstream repository](https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/releases). Here's where you'll find Qiqqa v80 and later.
- Qiqqa Commercial software installer releases are available at http://www.qiqqa.com/Download at least up to / into the year 2020 A.D.

  > Note: Qiqqa's SSL cert seems to have expired, so your browser will warn you about the website being *unsafe*.
  
  + Those very same releases are also available at GitHub [in the bleeding edge development repo](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qiqqa-open-source/tree/master/Qiqqa-Software-Installer-Releases)
  
- Qiqqa Open Source **Experimental Build** software installer releases [are available at the bleeding edge development repo](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qiqqa-open-source/releases)

  > **DO NOTE** that these releases are only lightly tested and may include grave bugs. Meanwhile you also get an early glance at the state of affairs in Qiqqa Features and Fixes County, which might be enough of an incentive for you to try one of these. *Living on the edge* and all that...






## Qiqqa Collaborators & Developers Wanted

You'll need to be a little technically experienced in the .NET world to get a build up and running.
