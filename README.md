# qiqqa-open-source
The open-sourced version of the award-winning Qiqqa research management tool for Windows

This version includes EVERY feature available in Qiqqa, including Premium and Premium+
Unfortunately we have had to remove the web cloud sync ability as that is the one area that involves storage costs.  Users are encouraged to migrate their Web Libraries into Intranet libraries, and use Google Drive or Dropbox as the 'sync point' for those libraries.

You'll need to be a little technically experienced in the .NET world to get a build up and running.

You will need:
  Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition
  Syncfusion Essential Studio 14.1.0.41 - you can get a free evaluation key from syncfusion - works for single developers for private/free projects
  
Then simply go to Qiqqa.Build and run go.bat to build the latest version into the Qiqqa.Build/Packages directory.
