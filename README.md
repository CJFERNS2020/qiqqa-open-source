# qiqqa-open-source

The open-sourced version of the award-winning Qiqqa research management tool for Windows

This version includes EVERY feature available in Qiqqa, including Premium and Premium+
Unfortunately we have had to remove the web cloud sync ability as that is the one area that involves storage costs.  Users are encouraged to migrate their Web Libraries into Intranet libraries, and use Google Drive or Dropbox as the 'sync point' for those libraries.

Would anyone who is interested in contributing towards this repository please contact @jimmejardine...
