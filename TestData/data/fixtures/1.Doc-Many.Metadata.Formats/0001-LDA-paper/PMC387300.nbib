AB  - A first step in identifying the content of a document is determining which topics 
      that document addresses. We describe a generative model for documents, introduced by 
      Blei, Ng, and Jordan [Blei, D. M., Ng, A. Y. & Jordan, M. I. (2003) J. Machine 
      Learn. Res. 3, 993-1022], in which each document is generated by choosing a 
      distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a topic 
      selected according to this distribution. We then present a Markov chain Monte Carlo 
      algorithm for inference in this model. We use this algorithm to analyze abstracts 
      from PNAS by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number of topics. We 
      show that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the data, consistent 
      with the class designations provided by the authors of the articles, and outline 
      further applications of this analysis, including identifying "hot topics" by 
      examining temporal dynamics and tagging abstracts to illustrate semantic content.
