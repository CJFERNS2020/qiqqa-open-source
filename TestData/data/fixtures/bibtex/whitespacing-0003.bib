FEATURES 

• Glass passivated 
• High maximum operating temperature 
• Low leakage current 
• Excellent stability 
• Soft-recovery switching characteristics 
• Compact construction. 

APPLICATIONS 

• For colour television and monitors up to 25 kHz 
• High-voltage applications for: 
  – Multipliers
