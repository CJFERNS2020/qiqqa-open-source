     <Abstract>
       <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">COPD has significant 
       psychosocial impact. Self-management support improves quality of 
       life, but programs are not universally available. IT-based self-
       management interventions can provide home-based support, but 
       have mixed results. We conducted a case series of an off-the-
       shelf Internet-based health-promotion program, The Preventive 
       Plan (TPP), coupled with Nurse-coach support, which aimed to 
       increase patient activation and provide self-management 
       benefits.
       </AbstractText>
       <AbstractText Label="METHODS">A total of 19 COPD patients were 
       recruited, and 14 completed 3-month follow-up in two groups: 
       groups 1 and 2 with more and less advanced COPD, respectively. 
       Change in patient activation was determined with paired t-tests 
       and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Benefits and user experience 
       were explored in semistructured interviews, analyzed
       thematically.</AbstractText>
       <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Only group 1 improved 
       significantly in activation, from a lower baseline than group 2; 
       group 1 also improved significantly in mastery and anxiety. Both 
       groups felt significantly more informed about COPD and reported 
       physical functioning improvements. Group 1 reported improvements 
       in mood and confidence. Overall, group 2 reported fewer benefits 
       than group 1. Both groups valued nurse-coach support; for group 
       1, it was more important than TPP in building confidence to 
       self-manage. The design of TPP and lack of motivation to use IT 
       were barriers to use, but disease severity and poor IT skills 
       were not. </AbstractText>
       <AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION">Our findings demonstrate the 
       feasibility of combining nurse-coach support aligned to an 
       Internet-based health resource, TPP, in COPD and provide 
       learning about the challenges of such an approach and the 
       importance of the nurse-coach role.</AbstractText>
     </Abstract>
     <OtherAbstract Language="eng" Type="plain-language-summary">An 
       important part of managing COPD is self-management by the 
       patient. With IT-based self-management programs, patients can do 
       this from their own home, which is easier for them and more 
       cost-effective for the health care provider. Our goal was to 
       explore how a generic Internet-based health-promotion program, 
       The Preventive Plan (TPP), containing programs to support 
       behavior change and health information, combined with support 
       from a specialist nurse, could help patients to manage their 
       COPD... Our findings demonstrate that a low-intensity 
       intervention can produce meaningful benefits, and provides 
       learning about the challenges of this approach and the 
       importance of the nurse coach role.
