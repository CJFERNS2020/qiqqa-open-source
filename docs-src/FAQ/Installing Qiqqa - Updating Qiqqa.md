# Installing Qiqqa / Updating Qiqqa

## Where to download latest Qiqqa?

You can find the latest (beta) releases at https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qiqqa-open-source/releases -- this is the repository where the main development of Qiqqa takes place and new releases are published first.

[Here's a short video showing you how to get to that page via Google](../assets/Downloading-Qiqqa1.webm) and how to download the latest Qiqqa Setup/Install EXEcutable from that page. [*(Same video in MP4 format if you cannot play WebM format: click here.)*](../assets/Downloading-Qiqqa1.mp4)

Once you have downloaded the `setup-v**.*.****.*****.exe` from the *Release Assets* as shown in the video, you should find the downloaded file in your Download folder:
